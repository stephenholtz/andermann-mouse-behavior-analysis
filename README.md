andermann-mouse-behavior-analysis
=================================

For analyzing data from ChR2 experiments from my rotation in Mark Andermann's lab.

Analysis for two experiment with hopefully mostly overlapping utility functions:
psychtoolbox3, or monkeylogic-based experiments. The two were quite different in design.
Will not elaborate further here (see my notes)

This repository should be set to private, probably.
